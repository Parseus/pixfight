# Pixfight

This is an opensource crossplatform clone of [WeeWar](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315005124/http://weewar.com/) pixelart turn based strategy with AI. Done in C++14 with OpenGL 2.0 ES / 3.2 Core. With native applications for each platform (iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, Android) 

## System Requirements:

Basically this should run on modern sandwich toasters: 

* 32Bit operating system 
* Single core CPU running at about 800Mhz (dual core 1Ghz recommended)
* 128MB RAM (256 recommended)
* GPU able to run GL2.0 ES or 3.2Core Profile with about 128MB (256 recommended)
* About 20MB disk space (depends on platform and build type)
* Music card (PC) 
* Mouse (PC)
* Monitor capable of running in 16bit colour mode with at least 1024x768 resolution (PC)

## Controls

Desktop:

* RMB move map
* LMB select
* Scroll wheel to zoom

Mobile:

* pinch to scale 
* use two fingers to move
* tap to select unit 
  
Gameplay:

* Click / tap on base to open build menu

* After selecting unit it will show its area of movement, tap in are to select path and confirm it by tapping / clicking on destination point.
* To attack tap/klick on your unit and select unit to attack (if you are close enough / artillery use range of movement)

## Download

Latest stable versions:

[Android](https://github.com/inFullMobile/pixfight/releases)  
[Windows](https://github.com/inFullMobile/pixfight/releases)  
[Linux](https://github.com/inFullMobile/pixfight/releases) - Please follow building instructions to run it  
[macOS](https://github.com/inFullMobile/pixfight/releases)  
[iOS](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Please download the source code and build it using xCode


## FAQ:

Q: Can you provide a *.ipa for me?  
A: No, if you want to run this game on iPhone/iPad please download the xCode and build it for yourself.

Q: Can I make a spinoff / modify it?   
A: Of course the whole idea of this project is to motivate people to make this even better.

Q: Do you consider support for other platforms like Switch, PS4, HTML5?  
A: Yes, but I don't have access to the hardware required to build it or test it. Most likely I will try to build HMTL5 version using Web-assembly.

Q: Can I contribute ?  
A: Yes! If you think you are able to help adding another platform drop me a line or fork this repo and make pull request.

Q: Why did you not make it a true cross-platform (Raw OpenGL + C++) ?  
A: I wanted to learn new languages and libraries and understand how to connect C++ code to native application.

# 1. Idea

The root idea behind this project is to show how to integrate C++ code with some 3rd party libraries into your native application, done in other platforms as a "business logic" Core game logic is written in C++14 and use FMOD, OpenGL and freetype2 as dependencies. Each platform uses this Core to render game in their native environment. (e.g: Android in Java, iOS in objC etc.)

AI in this game is based on the following article from [gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/129959/designing_ai_algorithms_for_.php)

Inspire for the game comes from [WeeWar](https://web.archive.org/web/20150315005124/http://weewar.com/) (no more exist)

# 2. Credits

Big thanks to [infullmobile](https://www.infullmobile.com) for providing textures for this project.  

# 3. 3rd party libraries

This project use the following 3rd party libraries:

2D Helper library - [FurionGL](http://rezoner.net/)  
Graphics library - [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl)  
Sound library - [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com)  
Font loading - [freetype2](https://www.freetype.org)  
Image loading - [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)  
UI components on Linux and Windows - [nuclear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear)  
Window creation and input on Linux and Windows [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org)  
OpenGL extensions [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net)

# 4. Building  

### iOS

iOS freetype2 library taken from [cdave1](https://github.com/cdave1/freetype2-ios)

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/iOS
* Open `PixFight.xcodeproj` 
* Set target to Simulator or use your appleid to enable codesign for device
* Connect device (if needed)
* Press `cmd+b` or press play to build.

### macOS

To enable freetype on macOS you need to download it by using eg `brew install freetype` from terminal

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/macOS
* Open `PixFight.xcodeproj` 
* Press `cmd+b` or press play to build.

### Android

Android freetype2 library taken from [cdave1](https://github.com/cdave1/freetype2-android)  

To compile the project you need to download:  

`SDK Platforms` API21, 22 (tested also on 27)  
`SDK Tools` CMake, LLDB, NDK

* Open Android Studio
* Select open and navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/Android and open project  
* Open emulator or connect your Android device
* Press `crtl+r` or press play button to build. 

### Linux

You need to install [codeblocks](http://www.codeblocks.org) to compile this project.

Before compiling and running you need to download additional libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev 
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
```

Also run codeblocks from terminal with sudo command to let it copy FMOD libs to `usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`

or copy them manually and remove following lines from pre-build steps in project:

```
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmodL.so" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so.10" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmodL.so.10" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmod.so.10.3" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
cp  "$(PROJECT_DIR)/FMOD/lib/x86_64/libfmodL.so.10.3" "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
```

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/Linux
* Open pixfight.cbp project file
* Press F9 or play button to build and run.

### Windows

This project require at least `Visual Studio 2017 community version`  	 

* Navigate to pixfight/PLATFORM/Windows/pixfight
* Open pixfight.sln
* Press F5 or play button to build and run.

# 5. Next steps  
  
  
* Add Undo / Redo move
* Game need a lot of refactoring mostly in C++ code
* Bugfixes  
* I'm planning to add hot seats mode like in Heroes game
* Multiplayer    

I will cooperate with [infullmobile](https://www.infullmobile.com) to create a fully functional iOS/Android version of this game.

I highly encourage everyone to fork / download and play with this prototype all suggestions and fixes will be appreciated as I'm not an expert on all listed platforms.
